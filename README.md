* Implementing a transformer from scratch and using it to build an ARLM for summarizing or extracting key information from financial papers and using it to train financial strategies
    - Day 1: Created the C++ Executables using CMake and installed and integrated the Eigen Library for matrix implementation and linear algebra operations.
    - Day 2: Created the Tensor library -> Focused more on 2D tensors, created shape functions, update operation, memory stride views for memory efficient matrix updation.
    - Day 3: Created the 3D tensors for batched tensor processing (heavily used in transformers) - implemented copy batch slicing, base batch operations.
* Building a backtesting engine from scratch to integrate with the ARLM
